# <Unique-password-generator-homework>
## Description
This project is my third homework assignment, and my motivation behind it was to learn how to use javascript on a more in depth level and to familiarize myself with its basic mechanics. I built this project to learn and understand what goes on in the line of code of a password generator. What I primarily learned is that when it comes to involving user input, much like in the example of this password generator, you have to include multiple combinations of the available variables, while usings the "concat" method, that is then combined based on the user's decisions. The biggest problems that this project solved were, for me personally, figuring out how to properly generate prompt/alert statements and how use "if" statements in order to get the project to properly work; I struggled a bit with figuring out how to properly organize the related lines of code, but I was able to figure it out. A key lesson was realizing that I legitimately had to layer out the code, line by line, of which, will describe what I wanted to be done.

## Installation
Firstly, I have to place my work onto Github. In order to install the work onto Github, firstly you have to create an account. Then you have to create a new repository and give it a name. Be sure to make this new repository public and add a readme. Once that is done, there will be a green button, and once clicked, clone will be at the top with three options underneath. Click the ssh option. And then copy the link. Then go to the terminal. open the directory (type in ls) and then change into the specific directory (type in cd and the name of the directory) that you would like to place this project. Then you have to run a git add . command, followed by, a git commit -m "enter description of changes made" command. Then lastly run a git push command to publish the project onto Github.
